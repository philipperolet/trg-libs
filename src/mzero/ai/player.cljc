  "A Player updates its state every time it needs via `update-player`.
  It can move by putting a non-nil direction for its move in its
  `:next-movement` field. `update-player` is called by
  `request-movement` and should probably not be called elsewhere.

  The 'world' will then execute the movement, which will reflect in
  the world state. It is possible that the player updates again
  *before* the world's execution of the movement, e.g. if the world
  has been paused by interactive mode. The player may have to take
  that into account, for instance by waiting until the movement is
  actually executed. When this happens, note that requesting the same
  movement rather than not requesting a movement might result in the
  movement being executed twice.

  Protocol implementations targeted at use by main.clj should be named
  {name}Player and reside in a namespace whose last fragment is
  {name}, e.g. the random player implementation will be `RandomPlayer`
  and will reside at `mzero.ai.players.random`, see `load-player`."
